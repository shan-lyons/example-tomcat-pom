This example illustrates how to set up an extremely simple webapp to run
with Tomcat.  This requires Tomcat to be installed (see 
http://www.coreservlets.com/Apache-Tomcat-Tutorial/ for instructions).

Check out the project locally, and run from the top level directory of
the app (make sure it has pom.xml in it if you are not sure!):
mvn package

Change to the target folder and copy the .war file into the web application
directory of your Tomcat installation (C:Program Files/apache-tomcat/webapps/).

Start Tomcat (C:Program Files/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.bat)

The application will start. Navigate to the following URL to see a very
basic servlet:
http://localhost:8080/<insert name of your war file, without extension>/exampleServlet
Ex: http://localhost:8080/example-tomcat-pom-1.0-SNAPSHOT/exampleServlet
